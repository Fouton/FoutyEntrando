# Codebase Usage
If using the codebase, unzip the "Unzip" folder in the main directory to create the assets directory. I'm too lazy to learn how to use pngs in github so thats how it is.

# Fouton Changes
Added Region lines to the maps, and the ability to track their quantities like a dungeon's vitals/checks.
Right click to increment
Scroll wheel to change totals
Left click to edit further (like a dungeon, didnt put the effort into make its own type)

# Entrando Tracker

A simple entrance randomizer tracker. There is no logic for tracking accessible entrances. Has some extra features for making criss-cross easier to track.

You can download it [here](https://github.com/Fouton/FoutyEntrando/releases)

## Usage

* Map in the bottom right is an options menu.
* Right clicking markers hides them.
* Click markers to select, and click (or drag) on the map to place.
* Hovering over a connector will draw lines to all linked connectors.
* Right clicking a dungeon notes button in the bottom right will increment the check counter.
* Clicking on a marker while dungeon notes are open will let you make a path to get to that check.
* Ctrl+Z to unhide markers, up to 10.

This is built on [Godot 3](https://godotengine.org) if you want to make changes or add networking to it.

cool!
